# THE CHICKEN-AND-EGG: remote state needs a bucket; the bucket should be created by Terraform.
# Resolution: this stack uses LOCAL state (no backend block) exactly once to create the bucket.
# Afterwards, the bucket is long-lived (prevent_destroy) and every other stack uses it.
# Its small local state file can be migrated into the bucket: see docs/runbook.md.
